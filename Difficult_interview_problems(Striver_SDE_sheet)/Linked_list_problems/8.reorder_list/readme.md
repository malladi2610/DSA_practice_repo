Below is a step‐by‐step guide (approach, algorithm, pseudo‐code, complexity) followed by a detailed C++ implementation that meets your requested format.

## 1) **Approach**

1. **Find the middle of the linked list**  
   - Use the fast‐slow pointer technique to locate the middle.  
   - When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at (or just before) the middle.  

2. **Split and reverse the second half**  
   - Split the list into two halves at the middle.  
   - Reverse the second half in place.  

3. **Merge the two lists in the required order**  
   - One pointer starts at the beginning (first half).  
   - Another pointer starts at the beginning of the reversed second half.  
   - Alternate the links: first from the first half, then from the second half, and so on, until the second half is exhausted.  

This approach rearranges pointers without modifying node values, and it achieves the desired ordering:  
```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → ...
```

---

## 2) **Algorithm**

1. **Edge Case Check**  
   - If the list has 0, 1, or 2 elements, you can directly return because no change is needed.

2. **Find Middle**  
   - Initialize two pointers: `slow = head`, `fast = head`.  
   - Move `slow` by 1 step and `fast` by 2 steps until `fast` cannot move further.  
   - At the end, `slow` will be at the middle node.

3. **Split and Reverse**  
   - Let `second = slow->next`.  
   - Set `slow->next = nullptr` to terminate the first half.  
   - Reverse the list starting from `second`.  

4. **Merge Two Halves**  
   - Have two pointers: `p1 = head` (start of first half) and `p2 = reversedListHead` (start of second half).  
   - While `p2` is not `nullptr`:
     1. Store `p1->next` in a temp variable.
     2. Set `p1->next` to `p2`.
     3. Store `p2->next` in another temp variable.
     4. Set `p2->next` to the old `p1->next` (temp).
     5. Advance `p1` and `p2` by one step each.

## 3) **Pseudo‐Code**

```
function reorderList(head):
    if head is NULL or head->next is NULL:
        return

    // 1. Find the middle of the list
    slow = head
    fast = head
    while fast != NULL and fast->next != NULL:
        slow = slow->next
        fast = fast->next->next

    // 2. Split and reverse the second half
    second = slow->next
    slow->next = NULL
    second = reverseList(second)

    // 3. Merge the two halves
    first = head
    while second != NULL:
        temp1 = first->next
        temp2 = second->next

        first->next = second
        second->next = temp1

        first = temp1
        second = temp2
```

**Helper**: 
```
function reverseList(head):
    prev = NULL
    current = head

    while current != NULL:
        nextNode = current->next
        current->next = prev
        prev = current
        current = nextNode

    return prev
```

## 4) **Time and Space Complexity**

1. **Time Complexity**: O(N)
   - Finding the middle takes O(N/2) → O(N).  
   - Reversing the second half takes O(N/2) → O(N).  
   - Merging the lists also takes O(N).  
   - Overall still O(N).

2. **Space Complexity**: O(1)
   - We do everything in‐place, using only a few pointers.

## 5) **C++ Implementation**

Below is a self‐contained C++ program that:
1. Reads the linked list length and elements from standard input.
2. Builds the linked list.
3. Reorders it using the described method.
4. Prints the resulting list.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Definition for singly-linked list node.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

// Helper function to reverse a linked list in-place
ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
    ListNode* prev = NULL;
    ListNode* current = head;
    while (current != NULL) {
        ListNode* nextNode = current->next;
        current->next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = nextNode;
    }
    return prev;
}

// The function that reorders the list
void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next || !head->next->next) {
        // No need to reorder if the list has 0,1, or 2 nodes
        return;
    }

    // 1. Find the middle via slow and fast pointers
    ListNode* slow = head;
    ListNode* fast = head;
    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }

    // 2. Split and reverse the second half
    ListNode* second = slow->next;
    slow->next = NULL; // Terminate first half
    second = reverseList(second);

    // 3. Merge the two lists (first and reversed second)
    ListNode* first = head;
    while (second) {
        ListNode* temp1 = first->next;
        ListNode* temp2 = second->next;

        first->next = second;
        second->next = temp1;

        first = temp1;
        second = temp2;
    }
}

// Helper to print the linked list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    ListNode* temp = head;
    while (temp) {
        cout << temp->val << (temp->next ? "->" : "");
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of nodes: ";
    cin >> n;

    if (n <= 0) {
        cout << "List is empty." << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    cout << "Enter the node values: ";
    int val;
    cin >> val;
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(val);
    ListNode* current = head;

    // Build the linked list
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
        cin >> val;
        current->next = new ListNode(val);
        current = current->next;
    }

    // Reorder the list
    reorderList(head);

    // Print the reordered list
    cout << "Reordered List: ";
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

### **How it works**:
1. **Input**: We take the size `n` of the linked list and then read `n` values to create the list nodes.
2. **`reorderList`**: 
   - Finds the middle of the linked list using a fast and a slow pointer.  
   - Reverses the second half in place.  
   - Merges one node from the first half, one node from the reversed second half, and so on.
3. **Print**: Finally, we print the reordered linked list.

This satisfies the requirement of reordering the linked list as:

```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …
```

without altering node values, only the node connections.
