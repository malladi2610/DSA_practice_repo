### Problem: Longest Consecutive Sequence

The task is to find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers in an unsorted array \( \text{nums} \), where the solution must run in \( O(n) \) time.

---

### **1. Approach**

To achieve \( O(n) \) time complexity, we can use a **hash set** for efficient lookups, instead of sorting the array.

#### **Key Observations:**
1. For an element to be the **start of a sequence**, it must not have its predecessor in the array.
   - For example, \( x = 1 \) is the start of the sequence \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \) because \( 0 \) is not in the array.
2. By identifying the starting elements of sequences, we can avoid redundant checks and only process each sequence once.

---

#### **Steps to Solve:**
1. Add all elements of \( \text{nums} \) into a hash set for \( O(1) \) lookups.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If the current number is the start of a sequence (i.e., \( x - 1 \) is not in the set), compute the length of the sequence by repeatedly checking for \( x + 1, x + 2, \dots \).
   - Track the maximum length of sequences encountered.
3. Return the maximum length.

---

### **2. Algorithm (Flashcard Style)**

1. **Input:** Array \( \text{nums} \) of size \( n \).
2. **Steps:**
   - Add all elements of \( \text{nums} \) into a hash set.
   - Initialize `maxLength = 0`.
   - For each number \( x \) in \( \text{nums} \):
     - If \( x - 1 \) is not in the hash set:
       - \( x \) is the start of a sequence.
       - Count the length of the sequence by repeatedly checking \( x, x+1, x+2, \dots \) in the hash set.
       - Update `maxLength` with the length of the sequence.
   - Return `maxLength`.
3. **Output:** Length of the longest consecutive sequence.

---

### **3. Pseudocode**

```
function longestConsecutive(nums):
    if nums.length == 0:
        return 0

    numSet ← set of all elements in nums
    maxLength ← 0

    for num in nums:
        if num - 1 not in numSet:
            currentNum ← num
            currentLength ← 1

            while currentNum + 1 in numSet:
                currentNum ← currentNum + 1
                currentLength ← currentLength + 1

            maxLength ← max(maxLength, currentLength)

    return maxLength
```

---

### **4. Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - Adding \( n \) elements to the hash set takes \( O(n) \).
  - Each sequence is processed at most once, resulting in \( O(n) \) total work.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - The hash set stores all elements of \( \text{nums} \).

---

### **5. C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }

    unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int maxLength = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        // Only start a sequence if `num - 1` is not in the set
        if (numSet.find(num - 1) == numSet.end()) {
            int currentNum = num;
            int currentLength = 1;

            // Count the length of the sequence
            while (numSet.find(currentNum + 1) != numSet.end()) {
                currentNum++;
                currentLength++;
            }

            maxLength = max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2};
    cout << "Length of longest consecutive sequence: " << longestConsecutive(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **6. Example Walkthrough**

#### Example Input:
```plaintext
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
```

#### Execution:

1. **Create Hash Set:**
   \[
   \text{numSet} = \{100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2\}
   \]

2. **Iterate Through Elements:**
   - **For \( x = 100 \):**
     - \( 99 \notin \text{numSet} \), so \( x \) is the start of a sequence.
     - Sequence: \( [100] \), length = 1.
   - **For \( x = 4 \):**
     - \( 3 \in \text{numSet} \), so \( x \) is not the start of a sequence.
   - **For \( x = 200 \):**
     - \( 199 \notin \text{numSet} \), so \( x \) is the start of a sequence.
     - Sequence: \( [200] \), length = 1.
   - **For \( x = 1 \):**
     - \( 0 \notin \text{numSet} \), so \( x \) is the start of a sequence.
     - Sequence: \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \), length = 4.
   - **For \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 2 \):**
     - Neither is the start of a sequence because \( 2 \in \text{numSet} \) and \( 1 \in \text{numSet} \), respectively.

3. **Track Maximum Length:**
   - Longest sequence is \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \), length = 4.

#### Output:
```plaintext
4
```

### **7. Key Insights**

1. **Why Use a Hash Set?**
   - Efficient \( O(1) \) lookups allow us to check for consecutive elements without scanning the entire array.

2. **Why Check `num - 1`?**
   - This ensures we only process sequences starting at their smallest element, avoiding redundant checks for elements that are part of longer sequences.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - By focusing only on the starting points of sequences, we process each number in the array exactly once, achieving \( O(n) \) complexity.

This approach is efficient and handles the given constraints effectively.


# This problems has a better optimisation when the fo r loop traverses through the numset instead of nums to avoid the redundancy and duplicate elements 

The provided code and the optimized solution are very similar in structure, but there is **one critical difference** that might be causing inefficiencies in your code, depending on how the input is processed. Let me break it down in a **1:1 comparison**.

---

### **Key Differences and Analysis**

#### **1. Traversal of the Input Array**

- **Your Code:**
  ```cpp
  for (int num : nums) {
      if (numset.find(num - 1) == numset.end()) {
          ...
      }
  }
  ```
  - You are iterating over the original array (`nums`) instead of iterating over the `unordered_set` (`numset`).

- **My Code:**
  ```cpp
  for (int num : numset) {
      if (numset.find(num - 1) == numset.end()) {
          ...
      }
  }
  ```
  - Iterating over `numset` directly ensures that each unique number is processed only once. In your implementation, duplicate numbers in the array might trigger redundant checks, even though the hash set is used to detect sequence starts.

---

#### **Why It Matters:**
1. **Duplicate Numbers in the Input:**
   - If the input contains duplicate numbers (e.g., \( \text{nums} = [1, 2, 2, 3] \)), your implementation will check for sequences starting from duplicate values, even though those values are already covered.

2. **Efficiency of Iteration:**
   - Iterating over the `unordered_set` ensures \( O(n) \) complexity since the set contains only unique numbers.
   - Iterating over `nums` might lead to redundant checks, increasing practical runtime.

---

#### **2. Debugging Overhead (`cout`)**

- **Your Code:**
  ```cpp
  cout << "The max_length is" << max_length;
  return max_length;
  ```
  - Printing debug information (`cout`) during large-scale operations can significantly slow down the program, especially for large inputs.

- **My Code:**
  ```cpp
  return max_length;
  ```
  - Removed unnecessary `cout` statements for cleaner output. Debug prints should be used sparingly during competitive coding.

---

### **Key Optimization in My Code**

#### Iterating Over the Set (`numset`)
The primary optimization is iterating directly over the `unordered_set` instead of the original array. This guarantees:
1. **Each Unique Number is Processed Once:** Eliminates redundant checks for duplicate numbers.
2. **Performance Consistency:** The iteration over `numset` ensures \( O(n) \) runtime for distinct elements.

---

### **Fix for Your Code**

Modify the loop to iterate over the set instead of the array:
```cpp
for (int num : numset) {
    if (numset.find(num - 1) == numset.end()) {
        int currentnum = num;
        int currentlength = 1;

        while (numset.find(currentnum + 1) != numset.end()) {
            currentnum++;
            currentlength++;
        }

        max_length = max(max_length, currentlength);
    }
}
```

---

### **Testing the Fix**

#### Input Example:
```plaintext
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2]
```

#### Execution:
1. **Your Code:** Will process duplicates (`2` multiple times), causing unnecessary checks.
2. **Optimized Code:** Processes each unique number exactly once.

#### Output:
Both solutions return the same result, but the optimized solution avoids redundant iterations and runs faster for large inputs.

---

### **Conclusion**
The key difference is **how the loop iterates**:
- **Your Code:** Iterates over `nums`, leading to redundant checks for duplicates.
- **My Code:** Iterates over `numset`, ensuring each unique number is processed once.

By modifying your loop to iterate over `numset`, your implementation will match the efficiency of the optimized solution.
