Let's break down what the provided code is doing and then discuss why it uses so much less memory than a more “standard” approach like yours.

## 1. What the code is doing

```cpp
int init = [] {
    // 1. Turn off C++ I/O sync with C I/O, which generally speeds up cin/cout.
    cin.tie(nullptr)->sync_with_stdio(false);

    // 2. Redirect all stdout to a file named "user.out".
    freopen("user.out", "w", stdout);

    // 3. Read input line by line from stdin into string `s`.
    for (string s; getline(cin, s);) {

        int solution = 0, minPrice = INT_MAX;

        // 4. Parse out numbers (stock prices) from the string.
        //    `_i = 1` likely skips the first character (often '[' if input is like "[7,1,5,3,6,4]")
        //    `_n = s.length()` is the length of the input line.
        for (int _i = 1, _n = s.length(); _i < _n; ++_i) {

            //    This line is effectively extracting the first digit of a price.
            //    (s[_i] & 15) means `s[_i] & 0x0F`—which is a bit-trick to convert
            //    the ASCII code for a digit into its numeric value.
            int price = s[_i++] & 15;

            //    Keep building the number if the next characters are also digits.
            //    e.g., if you encounter '1' then '2', it builds 12.
            while ((s[_i] & 15) < 10) {
                price = price * 10 + (s[_i++] & 15);
            }

            //    Compute the running minPrice and solution (max profit).
            minPrice = min(minPrice, price);
            solution = max(solution, price - minPrice);
        }

        // 5. Output the final solution (max profit) for that line.
        cout << solution << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}();

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& arr) {
        return 0;
    }
};
```

### Observations about the parsing logic
- The code is **not** storing the entire sequence of prices in a data structure (like a vector).  
- It reads a single line of input `s`, then **in-place** parses out each number by taking ASCII digits and converting them to an integer on the fly.  
- It keeps track of two variables while parsing each price:  
  - `minPrice` (the lowest price seen so far)  
  - `solution` (the best profit so far)  
- Once it finishes that line, it prints the result.  

In other words, it's effectively streaming through the input. If your code collects every input price into an array or vector first, you're using extra memory to store all those integers at once. This code never needs to store them all; it only needs the current parsed price, plus a few variables (like `minPrice` and `solution`).

## 2. Why it uses so much less memory

1. **On-the-Fly Parsing**  
   - This code does not create a `vector<int>` of all the prices. It reads the input line, picks out the prices as it goes, and immediately updates `solution` and `minPrice`.  
   - By contrast, if your code uses `vector<int>`, you store all the integers in memory. If the input is large, that alone can add a considerable overhead.

2. **Direct Character-Level Parsing**  
   - The bitwise trick `(s[_i] & 15)` is a way to quickly convert a digit character `'0'`-`'9'` to its numeric value 0–9.  
   - It avoids typical library functions like `stoi`, `stringstream`, or `scanf`-style parsing, which come with some overhead. 

3. **No Extra Containers or Overhead**  
   - Apart from the single string `s`, there is no other large data structure. After each line is processed, `s` is re-used for the next line, so memory usage remains roughly constant.

4. **I/O Sync Disabled and Output Redirect**  
   - `cin.tie(nullptr)->sync_with_stdio(false);` reduces overhead from tying C++ stream buffering with C’s `stdio`.  
   - `freopen("user.out", "w", stdout);` might be used to streamline output.  

5. **Different Environments**  
   - If you compare memory usage on different compilers or online judges, they can handle memory measurement differently. Even using `<bits/stdc++.h>` can add overhead (by including many extra headers).

## 3. Key takeaway

- **Memory usage** in your version is higher mainly because you’re storing the entire array in a `vector<int>` or multiple data structures. This is generally fine (and often clearer code!), but it does take up more memory—particularly if input arrays are large.  
- The above code is more “competitive programming trick” style: it processes data on the fly and stores only the minimum necessary state (a handful of integers). Hence, it shows 9.1 MB vs. 97.1 MB usage.  

That said, your approach of storing data in a vector is typically more straightforward to read and debug. Competitive programming tricks trade readability for performance and memory efficiency. If your environment can handle the higher memory usage and your solution runs within time limits, the more readable approach is totally fine.
